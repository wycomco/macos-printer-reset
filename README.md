# macos-printer-reset
The intention of this script to reset the macOS Printing System.
Its result will be the same as resetting the printing system through System Preferences.

This script is inspired or uses code by the article http://www.cnet.com/news/what-does-the-reset-print-system-routine-in-os-x-do/ and by this forum entry
https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/8695/programmatically-reset-printing-system-via-command-line#responseChild88985

This script should work for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and later. Please be aware that it has not been tested on macOS versions below 10.14 "Mojave".

For macOS 10.15 "Catalina" and later the integrated printtool reset command will be used.
